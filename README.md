A Pidgin/libpurple plugin that lets you send italic/bold/underlined/colored text, and view the same in return.

Forked from https://code.google.com/p/pidgin-irc-format/, originally by Eion Robb <eionrobb@gmail.com>.

## Compilation / Installation
### Debian / Linux
You'll need at least `pkgconf`, `pidgin-dev` and `gcc` installed, and maybe a couple of others I don't know about.

```
# Compile irc_format.so
make
# Copy in to ~/.purple/plugins/ (the default location for linux installations of pidgin)
make install
```

### Mac / PC

???

Pull requests welcome.
